React navigation:
it is a component based library
it gives you a bunch of components that allow you to ser up your navigation configuration
NavigationContainer is a component that you wrap around the components that needs navigation (typically your entire app)
use stack navigation:
const Stack=createNativeStackNavigator();
Stack is an object that gives you two components Stack.Navigator,Stack.Screen
the navigation prop that you receive as a prop is only available on screens that are defined in the Stack.Navigator 
and if you want to pass it to another child componenet you can pass it as a prop, 
and you can also use the the useNaviagtion hook also which serves the same purpose
and you can use useRoute hook to serve the same purpose as the route prop


Images:
to use an image from the web you have to do that:
<Image soruce={{uri:ImageUrl}}/> and here you have to set width and height for the image
because unlike local images react native does look at the dimensions of web photo

foreground:true tells android to draw the ripple effect on top of your Pressable’s content, not behind it.


| Hook              | When it runs                   | Safe for `setOptions()`? |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `useEffect`       | After screen is shown          | ❌ Flickers before update |
| `useLayoutEffect` | After render, before paint | ✅ No flicker, safe       |
| Inside render     | During render cycle            | ❌ Triggers error         |

Drawer :
refer to offical docs
