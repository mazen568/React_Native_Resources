android and ios differencies:
the shadow property for android you use the elevation property
the shadow property for ios you use the properties like CSS
      shadowColor: "#000",=> shadow color
      shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },=> here the shadow will be vertical only
      shadowOpacity: 0.3,=> how transparent a shadow is
      shadowRadius: 4,=> how the shadow expands
Using Gradients(mixing background colors):
you can install expo-linear-gradient(expo install expo-linear-gradient)
and set the colors prop on the LinearGradient component like that
     <LinearGradient colors={["#4e0329","#ddb52f"]} style={styles.rootScreen}>
      <StartGameScreen />
     </LinearGradient>
Rule of Thumb
üí° If TypeScript can clearly infer the type ‚Äî let it.
‚ùó If there‚Äôs any ambiguity or complex type ‚Äî be explicit.
Fonts:
expo install expo-font


expo install expo-app-loading:
Gives a utility component which we can render which will prolong the splash screen, and will ensure that the splash screen is still shown untill some condition is met
It allows you to delay rendering your app's UI until all critical resources (e.g. fonts) are fully loaded.
